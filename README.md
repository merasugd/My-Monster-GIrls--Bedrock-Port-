My Monster Girls is a resource pack that replaces the standard models of some mobs with female versions. Now monsters have acquired a more sophisticated and elegant look, while maintaining their original atmosphere in the Minecraft world.

* Adds unique female mob models, enlivening the look of the game.
* Retains the vanilla Minecraft style, but makes the mobs more diverse.
* The resource pack only modifies models, textures, and sounds, without affecting the mechanics of the game.

ozzyv_ was inspired by:

* [**redstonae**](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/fem-zombies+)

Sounds from:

* [**Cute Mob Sounds**](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/voice-for-cute-mob-models-female-mob-voices/)
