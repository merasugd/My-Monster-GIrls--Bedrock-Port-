Resource Pack ported by: Merasu

---

My Monster Girls is a resource pack that replaces the standard models of some mobs with female versions. Now monsters have acquired a more sophisticated and elegant look, while maintaining their original atmosphere in the Minecraft world.

*   Adds unique female mob models, enlivening the look of the game.
*   Retains the vanilla Minecraft style, but makes the mobs more diverse.
*   The resource pack only modifies models, textures and sounds, without affecting the mechanics of the game.
